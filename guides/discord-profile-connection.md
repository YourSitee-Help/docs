# Discord profile connection

While sharing your YourSitee link in your Discord bio is completely fine, you can also share it in a modern way: Discord connections. Connections are those funny links at the bottom of someone's profile linking to other services, such as YouTube, Reddit, and Twitch.

Before we begin, make sure you have access to both a YourSitee and Discord account.

## 1: Edit mode

Head over to the [YourSitee website](https://yoursit.ee) and log in. Then, at the bottom of the screen, click the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Edit%20Button.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button to enter Edit mode. Click the avatar image to open the YourSitee Account Settings.

## 2: Connections tab

Go to the Discord app and click the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/svgexport-61 (1).png>) Cogwheel to open your User Settings. Then, head over to the 'Connections'.

## 3: Add the domain

Return to the YourSitee user settings and click 'start' under "YourSitee on your Discord profile". Click the preferred URL to copy to your clipboard. Go back to Discord and click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Discord_AvJ4GJiqTG.png" alt="" data-size="line"> View more, then <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Discord_1WQ09etx5G.png" alt="" data-size="line"> Domain. Paste the URL you copied to your clipboard in the pop-up and click 'Next'.

## 4: Finalizing

Copy the 'content' from the Domain pop-up. That should look like shown in the image.

After copying, switch back to YourSitee and click 'continue'. Then, paste the content from Discord in the field and click 'Finish'.

## Last step: Verifying

When Discord detects that you completed the setup using YourSitee, the box turns green. If it doesn't turn green instantly, wait one or two minutes for Discord to detect the changes. Then click 'Verify'.

Done! The domain is now shown on your Discord user profile.

## Result

Here's an example result of a profile connection added to your profile.
