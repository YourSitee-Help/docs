### 1: Customization button

You may want to go to your YourSitee page and press the "Customization" <img src="../.gitbook/assets/buttons/customization.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button on the bottom navbar.\
After that select 'Upload image'.

### Finding the perfect size

After 768px screen width, the 3.55:1 aspect ratio applies.\
On smaller devices, the image height becomes larger.\
(Mobile users see a much larger image than PC users.)

When you choose a background image, you can't move it around. So, if you want people using PCs to see a character or something important, make sure to place your content within that box.
