**WARNING!** You can only update your username every 12 months.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When you change your username, it also updates your profile link. So, if you switch your username from hello to world, your link will change from yoursit.ee/hello to yoursit.ee/world.
{% endhint %}

## 1: Edit mode

Go to the [YourSitee website](https://yoursit.ee) and log in. Then, at the bottom of the screen, click the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Edit%20Button%20(1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button to enter Edit mode. Click the avatar image to open the YourSitee Account Settings.

## 2: Edit profile card

When in edit mode, click anywhere on the widget that contains your profile icon, username, and bio. A screen should pop up where you can edit anything about the profile card. Scroll down until you see 'Username' (image below).
