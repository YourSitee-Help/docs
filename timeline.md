## Alpha release — Sunday, December 24, 2023

On Christmas Eve 2023, YourSitee launched its alpha version. Users who already had an account were given the "Pre-Alpha User" role in the Discord server. Newer users were given "Alpha User". You had to fill out a waitlist and wait to be accepted to create an account.
