* [Profile fields](profile-card.md#profile-fields)
* [Link blocks](profile-card.md#link-blocks)

## Profile names

* Your nickname may include any character, but does have a limit of 30 characters.
* Usernames must be 0-32 characters in length and may only contain numbers (0-9), letters, (a-z), and underscores (\_). Usernames can not contain consecutive underscores.

### Good to know

* You can only change your username once every **12 months**,
* Usernames are not case-sensitive,
* Your username is connected to your profile URL. That means that the username @rob will take the URL www.yoursit.ee/rob,
* Learn more about changing your username [here](../../guides/changing-your-username.md).

### Username policy

* Usernames can include names of famous people, brands, or any known word. However, the username must be changed if the name is a trademark or personal claim of a famous person, brand, company, or other organization,
* YourSitee may change your username without notice,
* The display name may contain any character.

## Profile fields

Profile fields (under the "Extra info") are fields that may include your location (city, country, whatever!), occupation, school, and birth date. The text fields have a character limit of 30.

## Link blocks

In the connections section, you can choose from a list of the most popular online platforms and websites and direct users to your profile on that platform. Much easier and more compact than having to make one link widget for every social platform.&#x20;

You can also add buttons with custom text. At the moment, the buttons will only copy the content to the page visitor's clipboard.

## UID

UID ("User ID") shows your account ID on your profile card. This is incremental and cannot be changed. This also shows how many users have created their account before you.
