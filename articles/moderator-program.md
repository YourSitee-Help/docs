Server moderators are volunteer members of the community, who are trusted by YourSitee staff as reliable, flexible, and competent to have multiple levels of permissions within the server.

**There are two ways to become a moderator:**

1. Submit your application at the scheduled time. A form will be made temporarily available on the Discord server in the **#announcements** channel. Once you have completed it successfully, you will be able to start your trial period after a short training session. This document will contain all the public requirements.
2. One of YourSitee's employees, or one who has already reached the "**Moderation Team**" position, can recommend a person who will have the opportunity to apply for a moderator position, which is outside the advertised version of hiring
