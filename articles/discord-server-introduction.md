# Discord server introduction

## Welcome to the YourSitee community

In this article, Iâ€™m going to tell you all about the Discord server and provide a brief yet informative overview. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us on X/Twitter at [@YourSiteeHelp](https://twitter.com/@YourSiteeHelp).

## â€” WELCOME

* getting-started: In this channel, you can check out the basic rules for YourSitee's Discord server. As the channel topic hints, there will probably be more than just the rules here, but that will come in the future.
* announcements: Important updates are shared in this channel, usually with an @everyone ping. These are the major announcements. But donâ€™t worry, you wonâ€™t get notified too frequently.
* product-updates: This channel is empty right now, but the topic suggests that it will be used for sharing updates and changes about YourSitee's service in the future.
* staff-channel: This channel will share less important news, updates about the team, and server changes. It might also have some random stuff that isnâ€™t really necessary.

## â€” YOURSITEE

* faq: Check out the common questions about YourSitee. Make sure to visit this channel before starting a forum post.
* create-ticket: Right now, you can't create a ticket, but Satoko, the manager of YourSitee, mentioned that a custom ticket system will be coming soon. In the meantime, users of YourSitee should use the support forum for help.
* suggestions: Anyone can send their ideas to the YourSitee team using this channel. This is the main place to do it. If you try to submit suggestions somewhere else, they might get removed, and you'll be directed back to this channel.
* bugs: This is the place where you can report any bugs you find. Please give as much detail as you can, so we donâ€™t waste the Staff's time and they can quickly start fixing the issue.
* support: This is the support forum where you can ask questions while we wait for the ticket system to be available. Please write clearly so that others can assist you quickly.

## â€” COMMUNITY

* general: Welcome to the general chat of YourSitee's Discord server! This chat is for English only, and everyone participating needs to stick to the rules.
* general-anylang: In this channel, you can use any language you want. Even though it's tough to keep things in check, the community really wants you to stick to the server rules, even if no one understands what you're saying.
* showcase: This is where you can share your own Sitee & where others review your page. The moderation team likes to keep the channel clear from whole conversations though, those are for #general.
* link-your-profile: This channel is totally clean, but the name and topic suggest that we can connect our YourSitee profile to our Discord account in the future
* ðŸ’¤Lobby: If you've been in a different voice channel for a while without saying anything, you'll be moved to this channel. You can't talk here; it just shows others that you're away for a bit.
* ðŸ’¬Voice Lounge: This is the place where people can chat with each other in voice. It doesn't get used very often, but if you want to chill and talk, there's definitely space for that!

You did it! You've gone through the list of channels. This isn't all the channels on the server, but these are the ones everyone can see. We can't share any other details that aren't available to the public for obvious reasons.
