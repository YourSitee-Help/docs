Server moderators are volunteer members of the community, who are trusted by YourSitee staff as reliable, flexible, and competent to have multiple levels of permissions within the server.

**There are two ways to become a moderator:**

1. Submit your application at the scheduled time. A form will be made temporarily available on the Discord server in the **#announcements** channel. Once you have completed it successfully, you will be able to start your trial period after a short training session. This document will contain all the public requirements.
2. One of YourSitee's employees, or one who has already reached the "**Moderation Team**" position, can recommend a person who will have the opportunity to apply for a moderator position, which is outside the advertised version of hiring

***

**The following requirements must be met for successful recruitment and the start of the trainee period:**

* You must have a Discord account at least 6 months old,
* You must have been on the server for at least 90 days,
* At least 150 messages must be sent,
* You must be at least 16 years old,
* You must have good communication skills in English,
* You must be able to dedicate time to the server regularly,
* Be motivated enough to help other users,
* You must have a lot of patience and a calm personality,
* Be confident, but be open to feedback,
* Know YourSite service, have a registered account,
* Have no active or past 30-day penalties.

***

**These points aren't mandatory, but they might be helpful:**

* Experience with moderation bots,
* Excellent conflict management skills,
* More detailed and in-depth knowledge of how YourSitee services work,
* Participation in one of the YourSitee Programs,
* Other knowledge that may be useful to the server and/or server staff.

***

**After successful selection, moderators must meet the following requirements:**

* They must enable 2-factor authentication (2FA),
* It is recommended, but not required, to turn off private messaging for non-friends on the server,
* Comply with the rules and guidelines of the server, the Moderator's Code, Discord, and YourSitee,
* Discord about me and custom statuses must not contain discord invites or non-YourSitee-related advertisements or messages.

Server moderators must adhere to strict guidelines and a Moderator Code of Conduct that governs the use of their permissions at all times. A moderator may not appoint a moderator, the permissions and/or the rank are not transferable!
