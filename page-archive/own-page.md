Since YourSitee is still in the Alpha stage, just signing up won't be enough. You'll have to join a waitlist to create an account. But don't stress, it should be pretty easy!

## Where to join the waitlist?

If you want to join the Alpha waitlist, go to [https://l.yoursit.ee/waitlist](https://l.yoursit.ee/waitlist), complete the application form, and send it in for review. Usually, it takes about 2-3 days to hear back, but it could take longer sometimes.

There is no guarantee that your application will be accepted.
