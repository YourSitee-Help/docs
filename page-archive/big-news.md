## Beta is coming

You heard me, beta is coming! Around an hour ago, @YourSitee posted on X that Alpha will turn into Beta next Saturday, 28 September at 8:00 PM UTC+2. My predictions are...

* ...that a lot of new features will be added;
* ...that a lot of site and UI/UX improvements are made;
* ...that premium will be available to purchase;
* And so much more than this!

This also means the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/badges/softLaunch (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> badge will no longer be obtainable.

## Information & news

As soon as the 'update' has dropped, articles will be expanded and new articles will be posted on this site with detailed information. The most notable stuff will be posted on the [@YourSiteeHelp](https://x.com/@YourSiteeHelp) X account.
