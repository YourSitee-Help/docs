# Short Domains

YourSitee has several short domains which are alternatives to the default website, yoursit.ee. If you don't like the main website, there will be a second option, but will still show your page.

## Shorter links

| Domain     | Supports subdomain\*? | Supports URL\*\*? |
|------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| yoursit.ee | ❌                     | ✅                 |
| ysit.ee    | ✅                     | ✅                 |
| yrs.bio    | ✅                     | ✅                 |
| yrs.lol    | ✅                     | ✅                 |
| yrs.wtf    | ✅                     | ✅                 |

\*Subdomain: `username.domain.tld` (eg. rob.yrs.bio)\
\*\*URL: `domain.tld/username` (eg. yrs.bio/rob)

## How do they work?

Let's take my username (@rob) and the short domain `yrs.lol` as an example.

* If you visit `rob.yrs.lol`, you will be redirected to `yoursit.ee/rob`.
* If you visit `yrs.lol/rob`, you will also be redirected to `yoursit.ee/rob`.

Repeat that with all available short domains and that's how they work! There's no setup or such needed.
