# Short domains

YourSitee has several short domains which are alternatives to the default website, yoursit.ee. I have listed all the official and unofficial short links known to me below.&#x20;

## Official links

These links are managed and operated by YourSitee. All data collected (if any) falls under YourSitee's [privacy policy](https://yoursit.ee/privacy).

<table><thead><tr><th>Domain</th><th data-type="checkbox">Supports subdomain¹?</th><th data-type="checkbox">Supports URL²?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>yoursit.ee*</td><td>false</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>ysit.ee</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>yrs.bio</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>yrs.lol</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>yrs.wtf</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>

_\* The_ [_@hungary_](https://yoursit.ee/hungary) _account is the only known account that has a yoursit.ee subdomain redirect to their Sitee. Therefore, it is likely an exception granted to them by YourSitee Staff._

## Unofficial links

These links are **not** managed or operated by YourSitee, meaning that data collection (if any) does **not** fall under YourSitee's privacy policy. Please contact the site owner for more information.

¹ Subdomain: `username.domain.tld`\
² URL: `domain.tld/username`

## How do they work?

Let's take my username (`@rob`) and the short domain `yrs.lol` as an example.

* If you visit `rob.yrs.lol`, you will be redirected to `yoursit.ee/rob`.
* If you visit `yrs.lol/rob`, you will also be redirected to `yoursit.ee/rob`.
